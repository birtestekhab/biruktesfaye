  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am <strong>Biruk Tesfaye Teklewold</strong>, a civil and computer science professional with extensive experience in infrastructure design, highway engineering, and project management. Over the past two decades, I have successfully planned, designed, and supervised numerous projects in Ethiopia, including road networks, multi-storey buildings, and medical and residential facilities.</p>
    <p>My educational background includes a <strong>B.Sc. in Civil Engineering</strong> and a <strong>B.Sc. in Computer Science</strong> from Addis Ababa University. In addition, I have completed specialized training in asphalt works, CAD software, and spreadsheet management. I am a proud member of the <strong>Ethiopian Association of Civil Engineers (EACE)</strong>.</p>
    <p>Throughout my career, I have held key roles such as Project Manager, Highway Engineer, and Design Consultant, working with leading firms including Gauff Ingeniure Consulting Engineers and Net Consult Plc. My core strengths include strategic project planning, technical leadership, interdisciplinary collaboration, and ensuring that every project I manage meets the highest standards of quality and efficiency.</p>
    <p>Beyond engineering, my background in computer science enables me to integrate technology-driven approaches in design, documentation, and project supervision — ensuring smarter and more efficient construction management workflows.</p>
    <p>My goal is to continue contributing to sustainable infrastructure development through innovation, teamwork, and professionalism.</p>
